# Short v0.0.1 [deprecated] ![](https://github.com/vincent-herlemont/short/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

:construction: *Disclaimer : It's an experimental project that I used for learn rust. Most of the code are dirty and need to be rewrite.*

Short allow to manage easily **multiple cloudformation projects** with **multiple environments** using .env files.
